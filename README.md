As a team, we have decided to follow up virtually through Google Meet or Zoom every Thursday for analyzing ongoing project feature additions and solving issues that might surface during the development. 
 Every Friday and Saturday, we have planned to discuss and assign the next project deliverables among the team.

Choice 1:

2)  Selection of data to analyze from:

Traffic Violation Analysis Dataset
Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeevuncle/police-data-code

3) Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem or opportunity)

One potential business problem or opportunity related to traffic violation data could be to identify patterns and trends in traffic violations to improve traffic safety and reduce the number of accidents. Another possible opportunity could be to develop predictive models that can identify areas or drivers who are at a higher risk of committing traffic violations.
The dataset likely includes both numeric and categorical data, which would require different types of analysis and visualization techniques.
The dataset includes driver age, race, gender, violation etc.


4) Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)

Objective:

The Sales Data for Traffic Violation Analysis Dataset may be studied using Amazon services such as S3 for storage, Glue for data crawling, and Jupyter Notebook for data preparation and cleaning. KPIs can be developed extract meaningful insights like violations in different age groups, gender and race. The results can presented on Amazon QuickSight a cloud-based business intelligence service. Designing detailed and engaging dashboards for visualizing our derived conclusions after analysis using Amazon QuickSight.

Question(s)

At what time are most traffic violations committed do the seasons impact this at all?

Do men or women get more violations. How does location effect this data. 

What age has the most traffic violations and what is the most common traffic violation by that age group. 

 What race commits the most traffic violations. Does race play into weather a search was conducted or not.
